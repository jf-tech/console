- [✅] consider moving listbox to a separate package underneath win?
- Maybe have single vs double border for non focused vs focused window?

[2022/02/19 cwin]
- [✅] every Win should all use WinBase
- [✅] Win interface should NOT have those Parent/ChildFirst/ChildLast/NextPrev getter/setter
- [✅] Win interface adds a new method return *WinBase
- [✅] Sys creates a generic CreateWin method that takes a func to return a Win, the CreateWin
  does registration, setup parent/child.

- [✅] Now make the RunEventLoop a first class concept so all things (cwin.Sys, cgame.Game, and smaller
things like MessageBox) are all running with the event loop.
- [✅] ?? cwin.Sys and cwin.Win uses *Win everywhere. The problem is now we have ListBox which just
  embeds *Win, later will have a similar issue we can get back from *Win back to *ListBox.
  Maybe it's time to consider turning Win into an interface? Too much too big a change? Or never too
  late? - done. cwin.Win is an interface now.
- [✅] CreateListBox has dup code as in CreateWin

[2022/02/18]
- [✅] move clock.go from cgame to cwin
- [✅] add Run on Sys, obviously no gameover or pause key, just a func with a return value
- [✅] change the return value from bool to typed flags, to avoid confusion.
- [✅] cgame.Game.Run still there but with gameover and pause key, then relay the to the cwin.Sys.Run
- [✅] cwin.Rect.Overlap swap the return value order. bool second just like every other similar constructs in go.
- [✅] move FIFO and fileLoadingCache into cutil.
- [✅] move probability to cutil
- [✅] move direction.go to cwin
- [✅] move GetCurFileDir to cutil
- [❎] move abs to cutil
